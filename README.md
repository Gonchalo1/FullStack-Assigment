# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Full Stack Developer Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to our Full Stack Developer assignment! In this task, you will be creating a dynamic web application using the .NET framework for the backend and React for the frontend. This project aims to test your skills in building robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

## Objectives
- **Backend Development**: Develop the backend.
- **Frontend Development**: Create the frontend using React.
- **RESTful API Integration**: Implement and consume RESTful services.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Document your APIs using Swagger for easy understanding and testing.
- **Database Integration**: Utilize the provided SQL database to manage data.

## Requirements
- **REST API**: Create RESTful services and ensure they are well-integrated with the frontend.
- **Swagger**: All APIs must be documented using Swagger.
- **SQL Database**: Use the provided SQL database for data storage and retrieval.
- **Frontend Features**: The frontend should include:
  - Filters for searching and sorting data.
  - Tables for displaying data.
  - Other visual components that enhance user experience.

## Database: 
We have provided with a sample AdventureWorks database in this repository. You can simply download the AdventureWorksLT2022.bak file. If you are having troubles accessing the database, you find support [here:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

## Personal note:
We want to emphasis on smart and efficient work. We want to test your creativity. It is not about completing the assignment to perfection rather utilizing the time effectively. This assignment should take no longer than a few hours. Please submit the assignment within 24 hours of recieving it. 

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your solution!
